Adding support for a new CPU.
-----------------------------

In devo/configure.in, add target-bsp to target_configdirs. For
example, here is the relevant fragment for the mn10300:

  case "${target}" in
       ...
    mn10300-*-*)
      noconfigdirs="$noconfigdirs"
      target_configdirs="${target_configdirs} target-bsp"
      ;;


In devo/bsp, create a directory for the new cpu. Under that
directory, create directories for each board to be supported.

In devo/bsp/configure.in, add a case statement for the new cpu
and define 'archdir' and 'boards' as appropriate. For example,
the mn10300 uses a cpu directory named 'am30' and an eval board
directory named 'eval1'. Thus:

  case "${target}" in
      ...
    mn10300-*-*)
	archdir="am30";
        boards="eval1";
	;;


In the newly created 'archdir', create a makefile fragment
named 'cpu.mk'. In there, define the following variables:

  CPU_VPATH - Path[s] to source files. Usually, just
              '@top_srcdir@/@archdir@'

  CPU_CFLAGS - CPU specific compile flags.

  CPU_LDFLAGS - CPU specific link flags.
 
  CPU_DEFINES - CPU specific defines.

  CPU_INCLUDES - CPU specific include directives.

  CPU_OBJS - List of CPU specific objects common to all
             boards.
